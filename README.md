## How to run

Go to website: https://craigslist-tdot-search.herokuapp.com/

Enter anything in the search bar. You can set category as well, it is set to "for-sale" by default.
This website is completely written in python, with the page view in HTML (of course).

## Return value

JSON Object. Maybe in the future we will also output in different formats, maybe even as text. However, we have to be careful not to go against any terms of conditions for craigslist.

## Testing

Some tests are done. More to be added.
